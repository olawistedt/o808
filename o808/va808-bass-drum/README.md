Description: A real-time audio application for simulating the sound of the Tr-808 bass drum. This is achieved through a physically informed approach using circuit simulation of the original schematic. This was built for use in professional music production, with a focus on being accessible to use and lean in terms of computational workload. The underlying theory involved in this project is largely based on previous work conducted by Kurt James Werner et al. which is presented in the following conference paper. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267629876_A_Physically-Informed_Circuit-Bendable_Digital_Model_of_the_Roland_TR-808_Bass_Drum_Circuit
